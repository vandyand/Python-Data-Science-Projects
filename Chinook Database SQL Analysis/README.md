# Chinook Database SQL Analysis
Used SQL queries to investigate sales at this hypothetical company and answer business questions. 
The questions this project answered are:
  1. If we were to add another album to our store, what genre should it be?
  2. Who is our most efficient sales representative in total sales? In sales per day?
  3. What country should we focus advertising on going forward?
  4. Should we stop selling albums and only sell individual tracks?
