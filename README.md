# Python Data Science Projects
* Kaggle Competitions - See my profile [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/vandyand)
  * Titanic Survival Prediction
    * Used feature engineering to make the training data richer. Used grid search and recursive feature elimination with cross validation on five classifiers (including k nearest neighbor, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest and bernoulli naive bayes) to find the best set of parameters for the set. Final submission was in the top 20% of over 11,000 submissions.
  * Housing Prices Prediction
    * Used logistic regression and random forest to predict housing prices. Best submission was in top 60% of over 5,000 submissions.
* Bible SQL and Unsupervised Learning Analysis
  * Used a bible dataset by [Scrollmapper](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases) to find interesting patterns in the Bible.
